# Wordle Game

Project part of an online React course. I choose to do this to practice my React skills. Key project functionalities:

  - To be played on a computer only!
  - You can make new guesses.
  - Letters will be marked accordingly if they are included in the word but not in the right place (yellow), if they are included in the word and in the right place (green) or if they are not included in the word at all (grey).
  - If you did not find the answer after 6 tries the solution will be shown.
  - If you find the answer you will be told how many turns you needed.

## Tech used

HTML, CSS and React.
